How to add a new set of styles:
Set up a .scss file in folder "sorchapatterns"
C:\Users\smoos\Documents\ESFA\govuk-testproject\app\assets\sass\sorchapatterns

Input styles

Then link to new file from file "application.scss" (one folder level up) in C:\Users\smoos\Documents\ESFA\govuk-testproject\app\assets\sass
And copy and paste @import 'sorchapatterns/FILENAME'; 	- and save the "application.scss" file - this calls in your new sass file to include your new styles
