3.1 yes, heard of this, transfewr surplus funds 10%
3.2 sender of transfers - people within supply chain
3.3 
putting more ownice on him to do the work, and they don't want to do the work - 
If i put £20k to them, they they will use it. 
If I have to pay the providers then ithas to go through my account, & then my account is not clean anymore. My board wants to see what is being used. 3million
will ake internal account processes more diffcult.


January this year or last year, part of a working group set up by DFE, small roup of employers across industries, one solution was that there is a lot of opportunitry for bad practice, coudl transfer to another employer, then opens them up to corruption issues, (if they owed the receiver £20k) consutrction industry training board, working on behalf of contruction industry, can we transfer into that body, a central reposibory for unused funds, every piece of feedback has been the same, not have any reply on that yet. 

my solution is not the best one - putting more work on them to give to someone else, dont want employers contacting me asking, where is the process? how will they know if i have surplus funds, then how will they know. No fair & equitabl way for this to work. 
Surplus funds should go into a fund

Longevity ofthe surplus funds. If i have some left over after 18months, if pot only lasts 6 months, then they will not have been able to fund for 12 month programme. Resetting of clock for the feedback already given from group.

remaining budget 32k
what is the budget to start with
is this only in year


lifetime of 2 years - if only 6months to go will it cover lifetime
how long will this last

if it comes from my account - will it take new money from my account when I don't want it to

on cohorts dashboard, not sure what boxes are - are they all related to transfer or just one.

where will transferred apprentices appear?

financial transactions mixed in with all - 

would like another overview box which says funds transferred & what that commitment is 
woud still rather pay it out rather than have it still in my account - 
how to contraacts work? is the contract btwn me & provider - not my apprentices? I dont' know if the apprentice has left -& i have no control am I paying for something no longer existing
